# Plant Pardy
_Be sure to check the PR for code specific feedback_

## General Notes
* This looks great -- super clean, efficient code
* If you click "view your plants" before you've picked any plants, it appears the app is broken -- just an edge case to consider
* I would remove the social icons and instead put the links to your github page and all of your personal linkedins
* I don't see an "About Us" page (minus 1 point) -- make sure to add that so all the plant parent recruiters can find you! :) 
* I only see one page that accepts user input (minus 1 point)
* The mobile first design looks great -- be aware of how it looks on desktop though -- I had a (very) minor display issue on the home page
